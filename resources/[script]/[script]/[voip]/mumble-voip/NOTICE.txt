This is a modified version of mumble-voip to work with sm-radio.
Because of this, this script may be outdated at present time.

To apply the same changes to a newer version of mumble-voip do the following:
At the top of the script, below the local variables add the code below

local SpeakingVolume = 1.0
function SetRadioVolume(v) SpeakingVolume = v end
exports("SetRadioVolume", SetRadioVolume)
